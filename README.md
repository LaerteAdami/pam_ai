## Task 1
The task consists in a game where an agent must find the shortest path in a rectangular grid (with dimensions height $h$ and width $w$) where each cell has a random value between 0 and 9. The agent starts at the upper-left corner of the grid and reaches the end at the lower-right corner of the grid.

The problem is solved with the Jupyter notebook **notebook1** found in the folder */notebook*.

Usa Google Colab, installando il programma (ti serve setup.py)
!pip instal git+https://.. indirizzo della cartella

Dovresti usarlo soprattutto per la task 3 --> Pytorch funziona meglio con tanta GPU quindi meglio farlo sul cluster
