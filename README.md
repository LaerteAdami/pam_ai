## Task 1
The task consists in a game where an agent must find the shortest path in a rectangular grid (with dimensions height $h$ and width $w$) where each cell has a random value between 0 and 9. The agent starts at the upper-left corner of the grid and reaches the end at the lower-right corner of the grid.

The problem is solved with the Jupyter notebook **Task1** found in the folder */notebook*.

## Task 2
The objective of this task is to develop a neural network from scratch, starting with its main constituent parts. The neural network, fully parameterizable according to the number of nodes, the type of activation functions, and the presence or absence of dropout logic, was developed through the use of classes in Python, building the functioning mainly on the numpy package. Details on the development of neural networks are given in the report. Finally, the results obtained with the application to the famous MNIST dataset are presented.

The problem is solved with the Jupyter notebook **Task2** found in the folder */notebook*.

## Task 3

This task involves the use of the PyTorch package for the development of deep learning neural networks for solving an image dataset (Fashion MNIST in Jupyter notebook **Task3_1** found in the folder */notebook*) and a classification problem (airline satisfaction in Jupyter notebook **Task3_2** found in the folder */notebook*).

For the dataset Fashion MNIST: to import the dataset, you need to download the two files 'fashion-mnist_train.csv' and 'fashion-mnist_test.csv' from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist and save them in the *data/*  folder of the repository.
